        <section id="intro">Welcome to <a href="#palaceland">PalaceLand</a>, world renown <q>Land of endless palaces and <a href="#delight">delights</a></q>. As you make your way about, remember the words of our founder <blockquote>Shouldn't we have <a href="#chairs">chairs</a>? Never made much sense wandering room a room looking for a place to sit a spell. Folk that don't sit are not likely all right in the <a href="#head">head</a></blockquote></section>
        <section id="guideline">There are guidelines to follow while in <a href="#palaceland">PalaceLand</a>. They are outlined on the back of your <q>Daring Footman <a href="#trademark">(tm)</a></q> card. But the spirit of the guidelines are best summed up by our founder <blockquote>Don't just <a href="#standthere">stand there</a> with your mouth hanging open waiting for a pair of nesting birds.</blockquote> (and no <a href="#camera_policy">flash photography</a> please.)</section>
